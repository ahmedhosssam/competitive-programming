cur += a[i]  - cur%a[i]        // to get a number that is "strictly bigger"

use set<int> for unique values

sum+=(2*i-1)*i

sqrtl() // to get the sqrt of a long numebr

You can pop_back() and back() on strings    // yeah I didn't know that

Use deque<int> if needed    // push and pop from back and front, very useful

for (int x : {arr[0], arr[n - 1]})  // another way to iterate over an array

    12 46 20

    If we will iterate from left to right we will get:

    1) 12 < 46. Don't change the array
    2) 46 > 20. Split 46 by 4 and 6

    And we got:
    12 4 6 20. Which is not a non-growth sorted array.  // iteration from left to right is wrong

    If we will iterate from right to left we will get:
    1) 46 > 20. Split 46 by 4 and 6
    2) 12 > 4. Split 12 by 1 and 2

    And we got:
    1 2 4 6 20. Which is a non-growth sorted array.     // iteration from right to left is right
